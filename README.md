# Android-project
<p>This app is developed using <b>Android Studio</b>. It automatically detects your current location and provides data about current weather situation at your location. It also provides predicted weather data for 7 days. It uses API packages from http://openweathermap.org/api.</p>
<p>
To get weather data for a new city you can enter the city name to search and it uses the latitude and longitude obtained from the API call to <b>Current Weather data</b> API and gets the 7 days forecasted data from <b>Onecall</b> API using longitude and latitude because in <b>Current Weather Data</b> API we can get the data using city name also but in <b>OneCall</b> API we have to use the latitude and longitude to get the forecast data.
